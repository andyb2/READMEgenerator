## ```Description```
 The purpose of this project was to create a README generator. 
 
 The goals for this project:

1. Use inquirer to prompt the user through a series of questions
2. create a README template
3. The template should include Description, Table of contents, Usage, Credits, Questions and a license if the user chooses to have one
4. Each answered question will be added to the README template
5. Once all the questions have been answered a README will be generated

 

## ```Table of Contents```
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [Questions](#questions)
* [License](#license)

## ```Installation```

## ```Usage```
1. Open index.js with terminal and run node index.js

2. The user will be prompted with questions one by one. In this case I passed empty responses into the questions to show them all.

3. After all the questions have been answered a generated README will appear in the Develop folder with all inputs to the questions
